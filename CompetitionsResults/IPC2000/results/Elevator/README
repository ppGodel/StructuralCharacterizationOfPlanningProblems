The Elevator domain consisted of 4 subtracks.

 1. A simple strips version M10-Strips
 2. A simplified adl version M10-Simple.
 3. A full adl version M10-Full.
 4. A full adl version with the added constraint that only 6 people at
    a time could be on board the elevator M10-Full-Space.

 Note that the problem sets for 3 and 4 were identical---pddl has no
 provision for expressing the space constraint. However, the space
 constraint was checked.

 The excell files do not contain all of the results. They contain only
 those results that were valid at the time of the
 competition. Subsequently, some updated correct results were
 submitted. These updated results are stored in the above 4
 directories, but not in the excell files. Some day I should update
 the excell files as well.
