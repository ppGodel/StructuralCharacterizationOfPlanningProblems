There are two directories, Track1 and Track2.

In Track1/ there are some files of the form [login-name]-strips. These
are the results for an abortive attempt at encoding the schedule
domain as a strips domain. The encoding generated problems for
various planners, and we were no longer convinced of its
correctness. Thus these results were excluded from the
competition. The results included in the competition are all in the
excell spread sheets. (The files that do not have the -strips suffix).

In Track2/ there is a file of results for shop. These results do not
appear in the excell spread sheet as they also were completed after
the competition.
