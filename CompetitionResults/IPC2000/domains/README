This directory contains all of the test problems (and a few more) used
in the competition. Each test problem (a pddl file) contains a unique
name. This name is what is used in in the test result files
2000-Results, to tag the solution and timings produced. 

There were 5 test domains, Blocks, Elevator, Freecell, Logisitics, and
Schedule. In the directories there might be Track1 and Track2
subdirectories (if the problem sets were distinct between the two
tracks---they generally were). Then their might also be Typed/Untyped
subdirectories. The problems are the same, but the Typed
subdirectories contain "domain.pddl" and "problem....pddl" files that
use typing.

Finally, at the very bottom level will be a directory containing a
collection of problem files "prob<domain-name>-id.pddl" where "id" is
some numeric identification. Generally id is of the form "n-i" where n
is the "size" of the problem and "i" is the "i'th problem of that
size. For example: 

probschedule-10-1.pddl

is a problem from the schedule domain of size 10, it is problem number
1 of the problems of size 10.
